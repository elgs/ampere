/// End-to-end transition tests for the auto-manage state machine.
///
/// These tests simulate sequences of events (plug/unplug, battery drain,
/// battery charge) by repeatedly invoking the pure `evaluateAutoManageStep`
/// function — the same function `refresh()` uses in production — and
/// asserting that the resulting state and issued SMC actions match the
/// documented rules:
///
///   Rule 1 — battery falls below lower bound on AC (or is already below
///            lower bound when AC is reconnected) → charge all the way to
///            the upper bound.
///   Rule 2 — AC disconnected while charging above the lower bound → stop
///            at the point of interruption; do not auto-charge past the
///            lower bound on reconnect unless the user explicitly toggles.
///   Rule 3 — between bounds, never auto-charge to upper unless user asks.
